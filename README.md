# topcam-tracker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tue-firefly/topcam-tracker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tue-firefly/topcam-tracker)
Captures and processes a live camera feed to locate drones

## Building
topcam-tracker runs on Linux-based platforms. Run the provided `install.sh` script to install all necessary dependencies.
Supported distributions are:
- Arch linux
- Ubuntu Xenial Xerus (16.04 LTS)
- Ubuntu Artful Aardvark (17.10)
- Linux Mint Sonya (18.2)

`install.sh` assumes you have both `curl` and `sudo` installed, install these first in the unlikely case you don't have them already.

Before building, `source .env` or `. .env` should be run. This only has to be done once every time a new terminal is used.

## Running
First, the environment variables must be set correctly by running the command `source .env` or `. .env`. This has to be executed every time a new terminal is used.

Simply run the generated application with sudo while preservering your enviroment variables, passing the ip and port to send the position data to: `sudo -E ./bin/tracker 127.0.0.1 4444`. The data is sent over UDP.

If you receive the error "Not found", first verify that you can open the camera using the provided Vimba Viewer in the SDK.
Then when you have succesfully done so and the application still does not start, please file an issue with steps to reproduce the error (list distribution, `install.sh` console output etc.)

## Testing
Tests are included for the install script and basic drone detection functionality.
If you are testing new functionality locally you can just run `make test` to make sure things work, at least in your environment.

`dockerfiles/` contains a simple Dockerfile for each of the supported distributions, that will run `Ã¬nstall.sh` and build the application in a container. It will also run `make test` in every container to verify that drone detection works there.  Travis CI is set up to build these containers automatically after each commit.
